            <p>Lockjaw is a fictional, gigantic, bulldog-like being appearing in several comic books created by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics">Marvel comics</a>.
                Lockjaw has some cool super powers, the most useful of them is the ability to teleport.
                Recently he appeared in a tv show called <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154858/">Marvel's inhumans</a>.
                In contrast with the rest of the show, he managed to impress us with his literally immense cuteness!
